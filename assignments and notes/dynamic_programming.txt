Example:
You have three jugs, which we will call A, B, and C. Jug A can hold exactly 8
cups of water, B can hold exactly 5 cups, and C can hold exactly 3 cups. A is
filled to capacity with 8 cups of water. B and C are empty. We want you to find
a way of dividing the contents of A equally between A and B so that both have 4
cups. You are allowed to pour water from jug to jug.

solution:

Step 1: First fill the 8L bucket full.
Step 2: Pour the water from 8L bucket to 5L bucket. Water remaining in 8L bucket is 3L.
Step 3: Pour the water from 5L bucket to 3L bucket. Water remaining in 5L bucket is 2L.
Step 4: Pour the water from 3L bucket to 8L bucket. Water in 8L bucket is 6L now and 3L
bucket gets empty.
Step 5: Pour the water from 5L bucket to 3L bucket. Water in 3L bucket is 2L now and 5L
bucket gets empty.
Step 6: Pour the water from 8L bucket to 5L bucket. Water remaining in 8L bucket is IL 5L
bucket gets full.
Step 7: Pour the waterkrom 5L bucket to 3L bucket. Water remaining in 5L bucket is now
4L as 3L bucket already had 2L of water and when we poured water from 51 bucket to 3L
bucket we poured IL of water from 5L bucket and thus the remaining water in 5L bucket is
now 4L.
