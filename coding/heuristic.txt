There is a survey team , they have to visit multiple socities, we have to find the shorest possible path to travel
and the constraint is they need to visit to each the each society atleast once and return to branch office.

MainPoint = office
MainPoint => S1 : 12KM
MainPoint => S2 : 30KM
MainPoint => S3 : 25KM
MainPoint => S4 : 20KM

There are 4 societies,
S1
S2
S3
S4




expected sol,
Start
Read (societyl)
find(distance of nearest societies within time range)
if (condition satisfies then)
process(survey)

return to MainPoint
stop


Start
Read (a, b, c)
d = b*b-4*a*c
print(d)
stop

#program for the question:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

d = b * b - 4 * a * c
print(d)



Exercises:
