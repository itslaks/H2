Exercises:
1. A bear starting from the point P, walked one mile due south,
Then he changed direction and walked one mile due east. Then he
turned again to the left and walked one mile due north and arrived at point P he started from what was the color of the bear?
 
2. Two towns A and B are 3 km s apart It is proposed to build 
a new school serving 100 students in town A and 50 students
in town B. How far from town A should the school be built 
if the total travel distance by all 150 students is to be as small as
possible?
 
3. A traveller arrives at hotel he has no money but only a silver chain consisting of  6 links. He uses one link to pay for each day 
spent at the hotel but the hotel manager agrees to accept no more than one broken link

of 100 links? what is the answer in general case n days and n links
 
4. Rearrange the letters in the words new door to make one word
 
5.  do divide and conquer  6   5  1  4  3  2

6.  Draw flowchart for calculating simple interest



Answers:

6. flowchart:

(start) oval
   |
 input P
   |
 input R
   |
 input T
   |
 SI = (P*R*T)/100
   |
 output

 (end) oval


5. Divide and Conquer:

Start
1. Split array [6, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2] into [6, 5, 1] and [4, 3, 2]
2. Split [6, 5, 1] into [6] and [5, 1]
3. Split [5, 1] into [5] and [1]
4. Merge [5] and [1] to get [1, 5]
5. Merge [6] and [1, 5] to get [1, 5, 6]
6. Split [4, 3, 2] into [4] and [3, 2]
7. Split [3, 2] into [3] and [2]
8. Merge [3] and [2] to get [2, 3]
9. Merge [4] and [2, 3] to get [2, 3, 4]
10. Merge [1, 5, 6] and [2, 3, 4] to get [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
End


4. Word Arrangements:
start
seperate all the letters in the word -> "new door": n, e, w, d, o, o, r
Rearrange these letters
Form "one word"
End


3. chain-cutting:
Start
For a 6-link chain, we need to cut 2 links
Cut the 2nd and 4th links , Now we have four pieces
three single links and one 3-link piece are the pieces we have.
Give the hotel manager one single link.
Ask for your single link back, give the manager two connected links on second day.
Give another single link (manager now has links worth 3 days)
Get all three links back, give the 3-link piece
Give one single link.
Give the remaining two connected links.
now paid for all 6 days
End


2. School Distance:
Start
Town A has 100 students 
Town B has 50 students

There are 2 ways regarding the solution,
1) If the distance should be equal for all students (considering as single student)
then, the distance for school would be 1.5 kms

2) If it considered for whole scenrio,
the school should be placed closer to the town with more students. The formula for optimal placement is:

Distance from A = Total Distance × (Students in B)
                  --------------------------------
                          Total Students
​
 
Substituting values:
(3*50)/150 = 1km


1)The Bear's Color
Start
Set P as the starting point of the bear.
The bear walks 1 mile south.
The bear walks 1 mile east.
The bear walks 1 mile north, returning to P.
If the bear returns to P, then the path must have formed a closed loop.
The only location where such a closed loop occurs is near the North Pole.
Bears found at the North Pole are polar bears, which are white.
Output: "The bear is white."
End
