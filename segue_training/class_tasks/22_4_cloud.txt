Cloud Computing:

1. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, and applications over the internet on a pay-as-you-go model.

2. Cloud computing architecture includes frontend (client interface), backend (servers, storage), and the cloud delivery layer that connects them via the internet.

3. The three types of cloud deployment models are public cloud, private cloud, and hybrid cloud.

4. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides virtual machines, storage, and networking resources managed by the user.

5. Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers a development platform where users can build and deploy apps without managing the infrastructure.

6. Software as a Service (SaaS) delivers ready-made applications like email or CRM that users access over the internet.

7. Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are the top cloud service providers globally.

8. AWS offers services like EC2 for compute power, S3 for object storage, Lambda for serverless computing, and RDS for relational databases.

9. EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) in AWS provides scalable virtual servers to run applications.

10. Microsoft Azure offers virtual machines, storage, databases, AI services, and strong hybrid cloud support.

11. Azure architecture consists of components like Azure Compute, Azure Storage, Azure Network, and Azure Active Directory.

12. Public clouds are cost-effective and widely used for startups, mobile apps, backups, and testing environments.

13. Cloud services are scalable, meaning you can increase or decrease your resource usage based on demand.

14. Cloud platforms offer high availability and disaster recovery options, ensuring business continuity.

15. Cloud computing reduces the need for physical hardware and maintenance, helping companies save infrastructure costs.
