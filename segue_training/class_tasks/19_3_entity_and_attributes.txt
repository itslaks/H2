Entity and Attributes in DBMS  

Entity:  
An entity is any real-world object that has a distinct identity and can be stored in a database. It can be a physical object, a concept, or an event. Entities are classified into:  
- Strong Entity: Exists independently (e.g., Employee, Student).  
- Weak Entity: Depends on another entity and lacks a primary key (e.g., Order Items in an Order).  

Example:  
In a payroll management system, "Employee" is an entity because it represents a real-world person working in a company.  

Attributes  
Attributes define the properties or characteristics of an entity. Each entity can have multiple attributes, categorized as:  
- Simple Attribute: Holds a single value (e.g., Age, Name).  
- Composite Attribute: Can be divided into smaller attributes (e.g., Full Name → First Name, Last Name).  
- Derived Attribute: Computed from another attribute (e.g., Age from Date of Birth).  
- Multi-valued Attribute: Can have multiple values (e.g., Phone Numbers).  
- Key Attribute: A unique identifier (e.g., Employee ID).  

Real-World Example: University Database  

Entity: Student  
- Student_ID (Key Attribute)  
- Name  
- Age  
- Email  
- Course  

Entity: Course  
- Course_ID (Key Attribute)  
- Course_Name  
- Duration  
- Fees  

In a DBMS, each entity becomes a table, and attributes become the table’s column
