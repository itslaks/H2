## 📌 Folder-Wise Detailed Usage

| Folder / File  | Purpose / Responsibility                                                                                                           |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `entity/`    | Contains Entity Classes as Python Models reflecting DB Tables. These hold attributes like Employee ID, Salary, Tax Info etc.       |
| `dao/`       | Contains DAO Classes with SQL-based CRUD Operations for all modules. Handles database logic cleanly using pyodbc.                  |
| `util/`      | Utility Folder — Contains `util.py` to manage database connection setup and configurations centrally.                           |
| `exception/` | Contains `Exception.py` for custom exception handling used across all DAO layers for consistency.                                |
| `main/`      | Entry Point of the Application (`Main.py`) — Provides user-friendly, menu-driven console interface to interact with the system. |
| `database/`  | Contains `PayXpert_schema.sql` — SQL Script to create necessary tables in MSSQL Server's `PayXpertDB` database.               |

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Microsoft SQL Server
- pyodbc (Python MSSQL Connector)
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

## 🔧 Complete Project Setup — Step-by-Step

### Step 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itslaks/PayrollManagementSystem.git
cd PayrollManagementSystem
```

---

### Step 2️⃣ Install Python Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Example `requirements.txt` content:

```
pyodbc
```

---

### Step 3️⃣ Setup Database in MSSQL

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Create Database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE PayXpertDB;
```

3. Execute SQL Script:

Load and run:

```
database/PayXpert_schema.sql
```

> This script will auto-create the required tables:

- Employee
- Payroll
- Tax
- FinancialRecord

---

### Step 4️⃣ Configure Database Connection

Go to:

```
util/DBConnUtil.py
```

Update with your MSSQL Credentials:

```python
class DBConnUtil:
    @staticmethod
    def get_connection():
        return pyodbc.connect(
    r"DRIVER={ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server};"
    r"SERVER=HP_PAVILION\SQLEXPRESS01;" 
    r"DATABASE=PayXpert;"  
    r"Trusted_Connection=yes;"
)

```

---

### Step 5️⃣ Run the Project

```bash
python -m main.main
```
